## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains the initial ball states used to train the policies in the
paper [Achieving Human Level Competitive Robot Table Tennis]
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03906). Each ball state represents the conditions of
the ball state immediately after it was hit by either a human or robot in the
real world. There are 15,792 ball states: 13,088 from within rallies and 2,704
from serves.

There are 4 important files:

* README.md \- This file.
* rallies.json \- Initial ball states collected from rallies in the below format.
* serves.json \- Initial ball states collected from serves in the below format.
* ball\_states\_viz.ipynb \- Notebook demonstrating how to load, roll out in MuJoCo, and visualize the initial ball states.

## Dataset Format

The data is in JSON format with the following fields:

```
'id': unique integer identifier for the ball state
'pos_x': initial x position of the ball in meters
'pos_y': initial y position of the ball in meters
'pos_z': initial z position of the ball in meters
'vel_x': initial x velocity of the ball in meters per second
'vel_y': initial y velocity of the ball in meters per second
'vel_z': initial z velocity of the ball in meters per second
'w_vel_x': initial angular x velocity of the ball in radians per second
'w_vel_y': initial angular y velocity of the ball in radians per second
'w_vel_z': initial angular z velocity of the ball in radians per second
```

The coordinate system used has \[0,0,0\] at the center of a regulation sized
table tennis table (1.525m x 2.74m x 0.76m) with x being the width of the table,
y being the length of the table, and z being the height above the table. X is
negative to the left and positive to the right when on the right hand side of
the table as shown below:
